    "### I'm using data provided by NathanGeorge on all Lending Club (https://www.lendingclub.com/) accepted and declined loan requests from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2018.  (https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### The ability to grade (or more specifically: predict the outcome of) a given loan is of tantamount interest to a lender as to maximize their ROI (return on investment).  A borrower with a higher risk is typically given a greater interest rate as to minimize loss in the event that they default, while a borrower with lower risk is typically given a lower interest rate as to maximize the chance that they'll choose their financial institution over another while still earning a profit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### A machine learning model could predict the likelihood of various outcomes (in particular: default/charge-off or paid off) based on borrower/loan data.  Lenders could better throttle their interest rates, term-length, and whether or not to accept a loan proposal based on these predictions.  How these predictions correlate with the lenders' own loan grades is also of interest, as it is in general a letter grade ranking (Lending Club uses A-G) of how likely a debtor is to pay back a debt.  Were they able to make as accurate of predictions as the machine learning model?"

To save some time, the unique 'id' column was set to the index.  According to Lending Club:\n",

When a note is in Default status, Charge Off occurs no later than 150 days past due (i.e. No later than 30 days after the Default status is reached) when there is no reasonable expectation of sufficient payment to prevent the charge off.  However, bankruptcies may be charged off earlier based on date of bankruptcy notification.\""
